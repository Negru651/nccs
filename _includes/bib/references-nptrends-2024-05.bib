	abstract = {Research Summary Our study generalizes and extends a cumulative body of research on diversification into the contexts of social entrepreneurship. We examine the extent to which internationalization and program diversification affect a coveted, yet understudied, outcome for social organizations—revenue diversification—and investigate efficiency as a boundary condition of those relationships. Our longitudinal analyses, based on roughly 53,000 observations of Canadian nonprofits that engage in social entrepreneurship, indicate that program diversification is positively related to nonprofits' revenue diversification, but internationalization is not. Further, we found that efficiency compliments these relationships. Our findings are partially in line with research from the for-profit literature, but also extend this line of research by suggesting that different types of diversification are associated with revenue diversification in the context of social entrepreneurship. Managerial Summary Founders, executives, and managers of social organizations often strategically design and implement programs and internationalization strategies to achieve better organizational outcomes. Our results reveal that pursuing program diversification opportunities are related to revenue diversification and that highly efficient nonprofits are more likely to increase their revenue diversification as they pursue more program diversification and internationalization opportunities. Social entrepreneurs and their organizations may therefore learn from, build upon, and to some degree tailor theories and strategies of for-profit organizations to better serve their social and environmental mission and ensure long-term financial stability.},

	abstract = {Organizational listening to solicit, consider, and incorporate information and inputs from diverse stakeholders is critical for tackling organizational and societal challenges. Yet, despite the potential benefits of organizational listening, researchers studying stakeholder engagement and communication have focused on how organizations speak to stakeholders while overlooking how organizations listen to stakeholders. Drawing on survey data from a purposive sample of 122 nonprofit organizations (NPOs) in the United States and 40 interviews among these organizations, we explored organizational leaders’ conceptualization of organizational listening, including what, why, to whom, and how NPOs listen. Results also suggested operational capacity was a key factor influencing organizational listening. This study builds on prior stakeholder research to suggest organizational listening as a more holistic approach to stakeholder engagement. The findings have important implications for the research and practice in organizational listening and improving diverse participation and representation in stakeholder engagement, particularly for NPOs and mission-driven organizations.},

Design/methodology/approach This study uses Internal Revenue Service Form 990 returns, US census information, and Oxford COVID-19 workplace restriction data and utilizes logistic regression to analyze results. Findings Nonprofits with greater COVID-19 lockdown restrictions are more likely to experience financial distress, whether measured by a 30\% reduction in total, program, management and general, or fundraising expenses. This paper also examines results by subsector using National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities data and finds that the Human Services and Public and Society subsectors drive the full sample results when the authors use total, program, or managerial and general expenses in the measure of financial distress, and the Education and Environment and Animals subsectors drive the results when using fundraising expenses in the measure of financial distress. Originality/value Broadly speaking, this paper contributes to the limited research stream examining the impact of crises on nonprofits. More specifically, this study is among the earliest to rely on quantitative data to investigate such effects.},

	abstract = {Nonprofit groups deeply rely on their executives to fulfill a demanding, often isolated, role leading the group in carrying out its mission. Although much research has focused on the effects of these leaders and great investment has been made in developing a talent pool to fill nonprofit leadership needs, almost no research has explored the experiences of nonprofit executives themselves. For nonprofit boards and nonprofit leadership development programs, this is a serious deficit in understanding the factors that drive engagement or withdrawal from the job. This paper reports the results of a two-phase mixed methods research study that applied the Job-Demands Resources (JD-R) Model to understanding the energizing and depleting elements of professional life as a nonprofit executive. Phase 1 featured in-depth, firsthand interviews with nonprofit executives from a variety of groups. Phase 2 progressed the research with a quantitative analysis of survey responses from more than 100 active nonprofit leaders. The results of both studies reveal important insights to supportively motivate and retain these critical executives: (1) leaders fulfill very unique jobs, although the JD-R model can provide an organizing framework for understanding their depleting demands and energizing resources; (2). Boards of Directors can act as a demand or a resource, and executives' (dis)satisfaction with their Boards importantly predicts turnover and burnout; (3) executives need more social support in doing a sometimes lonely job. Limitations and future directions for research are also discussed.},

Through propensity score matching with survey data collected in spring 2020 and winter 2021 from the New Orleans area, linked to publicly available PPP data, nonprofits that did and did not receive a PPP loan were matched on covariates representing critical resilience capacities pre-pandemic, allowing calculation of effect sizes for short-term outcomes. Results suggest that PPP tentatively supported nonprofit liquidity in the form of reserves, but had at best mixed results in promoting service maintenance, and did not support hiring or staff retention in excess of the non-treatment group. Despite the small sample size, these preliminary findings inform how PPP may have supported short-term sustainability and help guide future federal policy to support nonprofits during crises.},

All became executive directors because they wanted to help others. Less important motivations included influencing how programs operate, wanting to be successful, and wanting a higher salary. The paper proposes a new typology of career paths: founders who started their own nonprofit, fillers from the board or a volunteer position, planners who actively pursued an executive position for years, and risers who worked their way up through the ranks and found that executive director was the next step. Most considered themselves well prepared at the time they took on the position, and there was little difference among the four types of career paths in the level of perceived preparedness. The findings suggest that nonprofit organizations should pay more attention to training leaders who rise up through the ranks, and that management education programs can assist in this mid-career training. Future research should expand the examination of career paths and preparedness to a large and nationally representative survey.},

We explore whether organizations that serve mainly POC or those led by POC face greater financial challenges than others. We find that POC-serving or POC-led nonprofits experience greater financial difficulties stemming from additional challenges in resource development and management. However, POC-serving nonprofits led by executives of color did not show additional disadvantages compared with those serving mainly POC but led by White executives or POC-led nonprofits serving mainly White individuals. We discuss the implications of racialized organizations and how understanding this issue can help address the financial vulnerability of POC-serving nonprofits.},

At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, service provider professionals responded to an increased demand for programs and services with fewer resources. The increase in the demand for programs and services with a decrease in resources contributed to stress for these workers, leading to the phenomenon of burnout. To address the phenomenon of burnout, we propose that nonprofit organizations need to be systems thinking organizations and consider implications at the organization’s micro, mezzo, and macro levels.

Using the current population survey volunteering supplements and county-level census data from 2002 to 2014, we find that community racial composition does matter for people of color’ decisions regarding where they choose to volunteer, particularly for Hispanics. As the percentage of Hispanics in the county increases, Hispanics start to volunteer more for collective-type organizations, moving beyond volunteering for religious organizations.

Using a contract failure lens, we posit that nonprofits are more likely to have higher per-employee loan amounts and use funds for payroll than for-profits. Analyzing a sample of 174,496 first-draw loans across human service sub-fields, results suggest differences by size, particularly among single-employee organizations, and by nonprofit and for-profit recipients.

	abstract = {Nonprofits that serve particular communities are in essence products of those communities. Community logics are localized norms, beliefs, and attitudes that may impact local organizational behavior. Gender status beliefs, which are also normative assumptions about the abilities of women, may be transmitted into nonprofit organizations through community logics and may color recruitment choices for board members. This paper attempts to understand the relationship between these gendered community logics and the presence of women on United Way boards of directors over a period of 15 years. This paper uses a nationally representative sample of United Ways across 23 states to identify community characteristics that may change attitudes and receptiveness to women as members of boards of directors, an area of board selection that has been little studied. There is some evidence for community logics such as having more female local business leaders or advanced degree holders in the community being related to an increased presence of women on these prestigious boards, perhaps indicating new status beliefs and community logics around the abilities of women in leadership roles.},

	abstract = {Distilling decades of leadership expertise into an effective framework, this is a practical guidebook for nonprofits around the globe, with practical recommendations for the urgently needed steps to make this a better world. Charities in the United States and NGOs globally need to overcome two glaring and persistent weaknesses in the eyes of potential donors: trustworthiness and effectiveness. After examining possible causes for these deficits, fundraising and organizational development guru Ken Phillips guides readers through the process that leads to greater trust and respect by donors, better results for beneficiaries, significantly increased funding, and better and bigger programs. Alongside helpful worksheets, he presents seven steps to make sure ethics are meaningful, eight disciplines to ensure programs achieve good results, and a communications approach to demonstrate responsibility and accountability, all interwoven with inspiring case studies from his own international experience and other organizations’ stories. Staff and volunteers at registered nonprofits around the world, as well as any individual or group raising funds more informally, will value this guide to empower organizations to win trust, raise more funds, and achieve greater program impact.},

	abstract = {Using a qualitative research design, this study explores help-seeking during the pandemic. It focuses on two potential sources of support beyond government aid: nonprofits and social networks. Thirty eight low-income families and individuals in New York City who lost either income or employment because of COVID-19 and were experiencing hardship were followed over the course of the pandemic, for a total of 69 interviews. We found that social support flourished during the pandemic with younger generations more likely to help older generations than vice versa. Similar to past studies, we found that people hesitated to ask for help from nonprofits because of practical barriers, whether because of lack of knowledge or prior use or faulty perceptions of who nonprofits served. Contrary to past studies which emphasize the role of stigma in refusing help, moral and ethical concerns played a larger role, as people, and, especially those experiencing hardship for the first time, considered their own need in relation to others. Suggestions are made as to how nonprofits can extended their reach, both during times of great peril and less stressful times.},

The causes are manifold including the financing and regulatory regimes in which they operate and the cultural norms they are expected to follow. At the same time, nonprofits operate in environments laden with potential catastrophic, even existential risks, as demonstrated by the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the 2020-2021 pandemic and other recent events. These circumstances suggest that nonprofits must adopt a new paradigm of management based on resilience, not short-term and sometimes misguided indicators of efficiency. In preparing for the worst through resilience management, nonprofits can more confidently build a brighter future.},

	abstract = {Nonprofits, especially in rural areas, serve as safety nets for addressing social problems, but their leadership and contributions are also stimulating change and growth in rural communities. This chapter examines nonprofits’ roles in social and economic development in rural communities in the U.S. Innovative strategies and examples of rural nonprofit impact provide a distinct perspective on how these organizations improve and maintain quality of life. Cases from various rural and remote parts of the country showcase how nonprofits face complex issues of poverty, housing, education, health, and youth development. To accomplish this important work, nonprofits require organizational capacity, including staff, funding, technology, among other elements. This chapter explores strengths and challenges related to organizational capacity of rural nonprofits. Further, the chapter reflects on systemic opportunities and threats to rural nonprofits and their ability to help individuals, families, and communities. Finally, the unique environmental contextual issues of rural communities, such as isolation, culture, and political ideologies, that influence organizational operations are considered.},

With so many organizations in the increasingly professionalized nonprofit sector reliant upon their paid staff, this study assesses how COVID-19 has changed the way nonprofit workers think about their current and future work. We use a survey of nonprofit workers who have a nonprofit graduate degree to describe pandemic-related work changes and to explore the impact of these changes on their commitment to the sector. Our findings reveal that nonprofit workers are nuanced in how they approach their work and commitment to the sector. We distill our findings considerate of how future research should endeavor to unpack the degree to which workers’ personal and professional circumstances affect how they think about their work in the sector.},
