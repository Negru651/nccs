abstract: "The Regulation of Nonprofits and Philanthropy Project, hosted at The Urban Institute, conducts research on the regulatory frameworks that govern the nonprofit sector with the goals of 1) systematically documenting current regulatory frameworks across states, 2) deepening our understanding of how different policies impact nonprofits, and 3) promoting the diffusion of best practices across states. It brings together cross-disciplinary groups of scholars and experts to advance empirical research and our understanding of how regulation effects nonprofit organizations and philanthropy. The work has been done in partnership with the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy, the Tax Policy and Charities Project, Indiana University, the University of Pennsylvania's College of Law, Columbia University's School of Law, and the National Center for Charitable Statistics."

## Project History 

<br> 

{% include timeline.html %}

<br> 

The initial project was developed by Cindy M. Lott at Columbia University Law School over the period 2006-2015 with the title of “Charities Regulation and Oversight Project”. The Regulation Project was founded in 2015 at Urban Institute, subsuming the state-focused research, trainings and program offerings housed at 

Using a mix of research methodologies and data sources, this project fills gaps in our understanding of the nonprofit sector regulatory framework. The aim is to develop frameworks that are elastic enough to encompass the constantly evolving nonprofit and philanthropic sectors and provide resources to disseminate best practices.

<br>

## The Database



The Legal Compendium is a downloadable Excel spreadsheet with statutory citations showing the following information for each of the 56 jurisdictions featured in this research: the grant of jurisdiction to attorneys general and other state agencies, the registration and reporting requirements applicable to charitable entities and their fundraisers, the oversight responsibilities of state charity regulators in connection with certain transactions involving charitable entities, the obligations of charities to notify the attorney general of those transactions, and some enforcement remedies available to charity regulators.
